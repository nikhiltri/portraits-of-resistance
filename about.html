		<h1>About Portraits of Resistance</h1>

		<p align="center">"Contrary to the erroneous stereotype that Asian American women are passive and submissive... we are not afraid to rock the boat. Making waves. This is what Asian American women have done and will continue to do."<br>
		- Asian Women United of California, Making Waves (1989, p.xi)</p>

		<p>As part of my graduate program in social work, I completed an exploratory research project in October 2005 titled Portraits of Resistance: Asian American Women and Community Organizing. The goal of my study was to collect narrative data about the experiences of Asian American women who are community organizers. The questions guiding this study were as follows: What are the factors that led Asian American women to become community organizers?  What is the impact of community organizing on their identity development and sense of self?  What are the factors that sustain them in this work?</p>

		<p>I wanted to create this site in order to:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Disseminate my findings</li>
		<li>Provide a forum for people to discuss my findings and propose action items</li>
		<li>Spotlight Asian and Asian American women pioneers and community-based programs or organizations that are led by Asian and Asian American women</li>
		</ol>

		<p>If you have any feedback, or if you would like to be informed about updates to this site, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
