		<h1>Discussion</h1>
		<p>Twenty self-identified Asian American women, ages 20 to 46, who were active and committed to community organizing, with an average duration of 9 years of organizing experience, participated in this study. The women were from a wide range of racial/ethnic and geographic locations, but the majority of these women self-identified as heterosexual and middle class, and had attained a Bachelor's degree and an advanced degree.</p>

		<p>The major finding in terms of factors that led these women to first participate in organizing efforts was that the decision to become an organizer is a complex phenomenon with multiple determinants that have a powerful and enduring impact on individuals. Women in the study saw their choice to be an organizer as a result of many factors. First, all of the women in the study experienced or witnessed injustices as Asian American women, and they responded by eventually committing themselves to taking action and challenging these injustices. These women demonstrated empathy and a sense of affiliation to others dealing with social inequities.</p>

		<p>In addition, education about civil and human rights violations and the exposure to histories of marginalized groups provided crucial awareness and consciousness-raising for these women. Participants also described the powerful influence of family of origin, in terms of role modeling for social action, or alternatively in terms of painful, often traumatic incidents that eventually fostered a desire to take action against injustice. It is interesting that motivation toward organizing seemed to come through both negative and positive interactions, both painful and inspiring emotional responses, with the factors listed above, and this is similar to what is reported  in the literature (Herman, 1997; Louie, 2000; Surrey, 1993). These factors worked alone and in relationship to one another, in a different way with every woman, to impact these women in a way that they felt a need and responsibility, an internal drive, to participate in organizing efforts.</p>

		<p>These women had participated in organizing for at least two years, with an average duration of nine years. When reflecting upon the impact of organizing on their identity development and sense of self, several important themes emerged in the narratives. All of the women described how organizing itself became a part of their identity, echoed in phrases such as, "It's in my blood", "It's who I am", "I can't imagine my future without some form of organizing." In addition, organizing allowed these women to meet others who held similar attitudes and values and increased their sense of affiliation and self-worth. As suggested by several authors (Denison, 1995; Hartman, 2000; Lorde, 1984; Louie, 2000) many women also discussed the impact of organizing on their identity development in terms of increasing their awareness of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class and age in their own lives and in society. In addition, some of the women also described the impact that organizing had on the process of finding their voice. Once again these findings are in line with some of the themes reviewed in the literature on feminist theories and racial/ethnic identity development (Denison, 1995; Hardy-Fanter, 1993; Hartman, 2000; Helms, 1995; Kim, J., 2001; Lorde, 1984; Phinney, 1990).</p>

		<p>Additionally, these women offered a diverse and comprehensive range of suggestions for sustaining current organizers and for recruiting future ones. These suggestions highlighted the progress and tremendous efforts already being undertaken by existing non-profit organizations, colleges and individuals in terms of sustaining and recruiting organizers. Collegial relationships, consciousness-raising, mentoring, role modeling, and mandatory volunteerism were the focus of these suggestions. Other suggestions highlighted the gaps, such as the lack of formal support structures and leadership development and poor financial incentives. These appear to be some of the challenges and costs of organizing that were not explored in the literature or the findings, but that warrant further study and exploration.</p>

		<p>The passion and responsibility felt by these women to confront social injustices was striking and inspiring. Despite encountering many challenges, these women were committed to speaking out and taking action on their own behalf and for the communities they were organizing. The dynamic interplay between opposition and support shaped them and kept them motivated to keep organizing. These women were helping to combat injustice and help those in the communities they worked with, and in turn they were positively impacted by this work and willing to take the time to share their wisdom and help recruit others.</p>

		<h5>Implications for Future Research</h5>
		<p>Due to the small sample size and non-probability sampling techniques utilized in this research, replication of the study is needed to assess the external validity of the findings. In addition, given the broad range of ethnic groups encompassed by the label Asian American, future studies could expand upon these findings by either incorporating a more diverse and representative sample, or alternatively, by focusing on specific ethnic sub-groups. There are several themes that emerged with consistency in the research data and which parallelled the reviewed literature; these could be standardized into a survey for wider distribution and a larger sample. Examination of these themes on a large population of organizers would allow for correlation of data that was not possible given the small sample size and time constraints of this research project. For example, demographic data could be statistically assessed and analyzed with the factors leading one to participate in organizing and the impact of organizing on identity development and sense of self. This standardized method of data collection could allow for additional multivariate analysis of the many interacting factors that were reported by study participants.</p>

		<p>Future qualitative studies could be undertaken in order to explore in further depth the themes that emerged in this study. In addition, this study did not explore these women's choices to organize either in identity-based or locality-based communities. Nor did it explore the concept of transnationalism or involvement in organizing in countries outside of the United States. In addition, this study did not adequately explore the impact of learning from or working with other groups of color. Also, 80% of these women had engaged in some form of therapy in their lives, a surprising finding giving the literature. Is there any correlation between organizing and therapy?</p>

		<h5>Implications for Social Work Practice</h5>
		<p>The findings of this study, although they have very limited generalizability,  have implications for micro and macro social work practice and the integration of the two. First, the themes put forth in this study could not only help social workers increase their cultural competency with this population, but could also serve to raise awareness about the impact of oppression on marginalized groups, and in this case specifically Asian American women. This study adds to the growing body of knowledge that challenges stereotypes of Asian American women as passive, apolitical and "model minorities." The women in this study represented strong, bold, skilled and committed individuals whose life work it is to work within communities to promote social change. This knowledge could support the profession's own efforts to eliminate discrimination, oppression, and injustice. In addition, 80% of these women had engaged in some form of therapy in their lives, so certainly learning more about their lives and issues would be important for social work practitioners.</p>
		<p>General goals of clinical intervention include helping clients improve their quality of life, through access to services, decreased isolation, empowerment and self-sufficiency. If organizing contributes to these goals, as has been suggested in the literature (Minkler, 1998) and the data reported by this study sample, then it is arguably worth integrating into the practice of clinical social work in some systematic way. Empowerment and feminist traditions have begun to advance the field of social work in the direction of integration of political consciousness and self-help into individual, family and community practice. For example, self-help models such as Narcotics and Alcoholics Anonymous are routinely incorporated into clinical practice. Perhaps there are ways to further integrate social justice work and clinical practice.</p>

		<p>As suggested by participants, this study also illuminates a need for formal support structures for organizers that social workers could potentially provide, such as family and group therapy. Gutierrez (1990, p.152) wrote:</p>

		<blockquote>Social workers also need to develop skills in the area of small-group work and community practice if they are to work in empowering ways, and the organizations that employ them must support their efforts to engage themselves in social contexts of their clients and to move among levels of intervention.</blockquote>

		<p>Exploring the contributions of this group of Asian American women organizers offers an opportunity to revisit social work's own history and mission to promote social change. Perhaps social workers could work together with the women in this study and with others like them to alter the conditions that have motivated social change. The findings of this study support the literature in terms of the positive impact of organizing and the potential for social workers to engage further as activists, advocates or as providers of support systems for people who are active in their communities. As stated by Gutierrez, Alvarez, Nemon and Lewis, "Although these shifts may appear risky, they have the potential to reap great benefits for communities, the profession, and society at large" (1996, p. 507).</p>

		<h5>Methodological Limitations</h5>
		<p>The research design and methodology used to conduct this study impose certain limitations on the external validity of the research findings. The small, non-random sample limits the generalizability of the study's findings. The chosen methodology also has implications for the internal validity of the study. While two pilot interviews were conducted, there are biases in the construction of the study that must be acknowledged. The design of the guiding research questions and data collection instrument reflect the researcher's fundamental belief that participation in organizing is a powerful, positive phenomenon and an agent for change on both personal and societal levels. This predetermined ideology was built in to the study and may have influenced participant responses. This potential bias was mediated by use of open-ended questioning which allowed for uninterrupted narrative and incorporation of material deemed relevant by participants, even when not asked directly by the researcher.</p>

		<p>The combination of purposive and convenience sampling methods may have biased the research in the direction of specific types of organizing and perspectives because outreach was conducted primarily through contacts within the researcher's frame of reference. Additionally, this outreach method may also have influenced the recruitment of participants with high levels of educational attainment. A significant contribution would be made through replication of this study among organizers with diverse social and political orientations and educational backgrounds. In addition, through attempts to categorize and make general statements about participant experience, researcher terminology and understandings were imposed upon the data. While examples and quotes from participants were used in an attempt to remain as close and as true to the narratives as possible, researcher bias is clearly imposed in any process of data analysis.</p>

		<p>Another limitation is that participants were self-reporting events or situations from years past. However, this impact may be reduced because it may be the women's perception of past experiences and not the experiences themselves that influenced their participation in community organizing efforts. Possible cultural differences between the researcher and the participants must also be considered. Participants may have made assumptions about the researcher's racial and ethnic identities based on first and last name, and perhaps they noted the researcher's American accent. Based on these variables and other cultural markers that may have emerged during the interviews, participants may have felt degrees of similarity or difference with the researcher that impacted their narratives in terms of level of description or level of depth.</p>
