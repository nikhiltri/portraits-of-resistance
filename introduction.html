		<h1>Introduction</h1>

		<p>The goal of this exploratory research project was to collect narrative data about the experiences of Asian American women who are community organizers. The questions guiding this study were as follows: What are the factors that led Asian American women to become community organizers?  What is the impact of community organizing on their identity development and sense of self?  What are the factors that sustain them in this work?</p>

		<p>Asian American women face at least the double burdens of racism and sexism and many of the challenges and issues they face tend to be invisible in mainstream forums (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Encarguez Perez, 2003; Foo, 2002; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000).  However, in spite of legal, social, economic, cultural and historical barriers, Asian American women are also at the forefronts of community organizing efforts that are making lasting changes in their communities and beyond (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Encarguez Perez, 2003; Foo, 2002; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000). These community organizers are helping people address micro and macro needs and issues and challenging the many institutional, social, environmental and cultural forces that adversely affect people's emotional and physical well-being (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Encarguez Perez, 2003; Foo, 2002; Minkler, 1998; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000).</p>

		<p>This qualitative study explores the narratives of twenty Asian American women who have worked as community organizers for at least two years. Each community organizer was interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The interview questions were based on a synthesis of important perspectives in feminist thought, racial/ethnic identity development theories and community organizing literature.</p>

		<p>There are numerous reasons for social workers to consider the contributions of these Asian American women who are community organizers. Social workers are bound by a code of ethics that emphasizes their responsibility and commitment to eradicating oppression for all oppressed populations (NASW, 1999). Becoming more knowledgeable about community organizers in particular supports the social work profession's efforts to eliminate discrimination, oppression, and injustice by exploring the potential for growth and healing in a broad range of activities, including those that occur outside the traditional realm of professional treatment. There is a paucity of research on community organizing in the social movements literature in general, and particularly around gender as a variable in social movements (Caldwell, 1994; Robnett, 1996; Stall & Stoecker, 1998).</p>

		<p>In addition, various research studies and reports document the lack of data relating to the issues facing Asian American women (Asian Women United of California, 1989; Bui & Takeuchi, 1992; Cheung & Snowden, 1990; Foo, 2002; Fujino, Okazaki, & Young, 1994; Louie, 2000; Ro, 2002; Shah, 1997; Sue, Nakamura, Chi-Ying Chung & Yee-Bradbury, 1994; Zia, 2000). Further research on this population may help social workers develop more cultural competence with this population (Ro, 2002). Also, Asian Americans as a whole have one of the lowest rates of utilization of mental health services among ethnic populations (Bui & Takeuchi, 1992; Cheung & Snowden, 1990; Foo, 2002; Fujino, Okazaki, & Young, 1994; Ro, 2002; Sue, Nakamura, Chi-Ying Chung & Yee-Bradbury, 1994). As narrative and feminist therapies continue to push social workers to broaden their gaze and consider expanding the boundaries of clinical work, the findings of this study may offer glimpses into the experiences of Asian American women, the development of community-based helpers and the potential for healing and empowerment offered by community organizing efforts.</p>
