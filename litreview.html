		<h1>Literature Review</h1>

		<p>There is little research directly on the developmental pathways of Asian American female community organizers. Therefore, this literature review consists of four distinct sections that my analysis will serve to synthesize. First, I will discuss the general demographics of Asian American communities. Next I will provide a brief overview of the community organizing literature I am using as a basis for my study.  In the third section, I will offer a glimpse of some of the documented advances of Asian American women in community organizing. Finally, I will outline the research on factors leading to involvement in social action and the impact this may have on a person's identity development and sense of self.</p>

		<h3>Demographics & Concerns of Asian American Communities</h3>
		<blockquote>Given this "model minority myth"?several positive generalizations - such as Asians work hard, are technological nerds, are good at math, focus on education, and the like - were added to the negative stereotypes of Asians - such as, Asians are sly, ruthless, untrustworthy, submissive, quiet, foreigners, and lack communication skills and leadership potential (Kim, J., 2001, p. 69).</blockquote>

		<h5>Population</h5>
		<p>In the year 2000, Asian Americans constituted 3.6 to 4.2 percent of the total U.S. population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001). At a growth rate of 72 percent between 1990 and 2000, Asian Americans are among the nation's fastest growing populations by race (Alvarez & Kimura, 2001; Lien, Conway & Wong, 2005). Many Asian Americans have been in America since the late 1700s, but over the past three decades, the population has shifted and now the majority of its members are first-generation Americans (Alvarez & Kimura, 2001; Foo, 2002). Approximately 70 percent are recent immigrants and/or refugees, 40 to 50 percent of whom have limited English proficiency (Foo, 2002).</p>

		<p>The term Asian American is generally used to refer to any Asian or Pacific Islander who resides in the United States on a permanent or long-term basis, regardless of citizenship or other legal status (Alvarez & Kimura, 2001; Foo, 2002; Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004). Consisting of over 43 ethnic groups, the Asian American population includes 28 ethnic groups from the Asian continent and 15 from the Pacific Islands (Foo, 2002; Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004). As defined in the 2000 Census (Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004, p.3), an "Asian" is a person:</p>

		<blockquote>...having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, Vietnam.</blockquote>

		<p>Another census category called "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander," refers to any person "?having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands" (Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004, p.3). Clearly the umbrella term Asian American subsumes under one category a diverse array of cultures, social and political histories and experiences of immigration and migration. Although use of this label is problematic in that it suggests that there is a uniform, monolithic Asian American culture and that it masks the vast range of issues and experiences within this category, I have chosen to use this label and to interview women who self-identify themselves with this label for the reasons I will identify below.</p>

		<p>First, the term is political in nature as the census, federal and state funding guidelines, policy-makers and other government and non-profit agencies tend to use the category of Asian American. In addition, many community organizers and activists find the umbrella term Asian American helpful to use because Asian American women share the same status in terms of the racial and gender hierarchy (Shah, 1997). For example, Sonia Shah, South Asian American activist and editor of Dragon Ladies: Asian American Feminists Breathe Fire, states:</p>

		<blockquote>It is not that our lives are so similar in substance, but that our lives are all monumentally shaped by three major driving forces in U.S. society: racism and patriarchy most immediately, and ultimately imperial aggression against Asia as well. As long as those systems of distributing and exercising power continue to exist, it will continue to make sense to talk about Asian American women as a group (Shah, 1997, xiii).</blockquote>

		<p>Additionally, research on racial/ethnic identity suggests that the Asian American racial/ethnic identity is both socially constructed and institutionally imposed, and that members of the distinct ethnic groups of Asian and Pacific origins often adjust to this imposed identity (Espiritu, 1992; Espiritu, 1997; Saito, 1998; Shah, 1997). For these reasons, I have chosen to use the label Asian American while trying to remain conscious of its inherent drawbacks. Now I will provide a brief snapshot of some of the social, economic and mental health issues that impact Asian Americans, particularly Asian American women, in order to underscore the need for community organizing with this population.</p>

		<h5>A Sample of Issues and Concerns of Asian American Women</h5>
		<p>The daily realities of Asian American women are inextricably linked to the intersections of different identities and subordination based on at least gender, race and ethnicity (Aguilar San-Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Encarguez Perez, 2003; Foo, 2002; Kim, 2001; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000). Asian American women face many of the same issues prevalent in mainstream America. Asian Americans who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgendered, and/or genderqueer, face discrimination and oppression in social and cultural spheres, employment, housing, the military, family law, and other areas (Foo, 2002). Domestic violence and silence around sexual and reproductive health issues are concerns in every community regardless of race, ethnicity, class or sexual orientation. As with other groups of color, Asian American women have also been the objects of aggression such as racially motivated verbal harassment, property vandalism, theft, physical assaults, and homicide (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Alvarez & Kimura, 2001; Foo, 2000; Shah, 1997; Um, 2003). Especially after 9/11, South Asians and Muslim Asians have been dealing with a rise in racial profiling and hate crimes (Bork, 2003; Davis-Chopin, 2002; Gunew, 2004). However, the unique and diverse ways that Asian American women experience these issues have been largely unexplored.</p>

		<h5>Poverty</h5>
		<p>Similarly, stereotypes of the economically successful "model minority" mask the issues faced by Asian Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder. Asian Americans have one of the highest rates of poverty in urban and rural areas (Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004; Foo, 2002). Asian American families are the majority of users of public and HUD-assisted housing in a number of cities with large Asian American populations (Foo, 2002; Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004; Zia, 2000). In addition, the new welfare reform system denies equal access to public benefits to many women, including Asian immigrant women and their families (Foo, 2002).</p>

		<p>Additionally, the cost of health insurance remains a major barrier for Asian Americans who are more likely to be self-employed or working for small firms that do not offer employer-sponsored coverage (Foo, 2002; Um, 2003; Zia, 2000). According to the U.S. Census, it is estimated that 17% of Asian American children and 24% of Asian American adults are uninsured; up to 34% of recent immigrants and first/second generation Asian Americans are uninsured; and approximately 50% of Asian Americans may be medically underserved (Lien, Conway & Wong, 2004; Foo, 2002). In addition, cultural and language barriers also affect access to health care.</p>

		<h5>Disadvantaged and Abusive Employment</h5>
		<p>Poor Asian American women often work in low-wage positions as garment, home care and domestic workers, or they are employed in high-tech sweatshops with few, if any, opportunities for advancement (Espiritu, 1997, Foo, 2002). In these positions, examples of racialized and feminized labor, these women often work for minimum wage or less under hazardous, stressful, and unstable working conditions (Asian Women United of California, 1989; Foo, 2002; Mazumdar, 1989). Additionally, approximately 30,000 Asian women are brought to the United States each year through trafficking (Foo, 2002). These women are forced into prostitution, bonded sweatshop labor or domestic servitude. In addition, private agencies, brokers and "penpal" services bring thousands of women, mostly Filipinas, to the United States as mail-order brides (Foo, 2002). Many mail-order brides end up in battered women's shelters and there have been high-profile cases of mail-order brides being killed by their husbands (Foo, 2002).</p>

		<h5>Mental Health</h5>
		<p>There is a dearth of research about Asian American mental health issues and Asian American attitudes towards the mental health profession. Asian Americans have the lowest rates of utilization of mental health services among ethnic populations (Foo, 2002; Fujino, Okazaki, & Young, 1994; NAMI, 2003; Ro, 2002; Sue, Nakamura, Chi-Ying Chung & Yee-Bradbury, 1994). In addition, when Asian Americans do utilize treatment services, they are often already in a severe stage of illness. Mental health support is generally not culturally prescribed or socially acceptable in Asian cultures, compounded perhaps for some by fears of difficulties in communicating, discrimination, deportation, or other variables (Foo, 2002; Fujino, Okazaki, & Young, 1994; NAMI, 2003; Ro, 2002; Shah, 1997; Sue, Nakamura, Chi-Ying Chung & Yee-Bradbury, 1994).</p>

		<p>Many people may be surprised to learn that Asian American women have the highest suicide rates among women in the United States ages 15 to 24 years old (Foo, 2002; NAMI, 2003) and those over 65 years old (NAMI, 2003). Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death for Asian American women (Foo, 2002). In addition, a Commonwealth Fund Survey of the Health of Adolescent Girls, reported that Asian American adolescent girls had the highest rates of depressive symptoms of all racial/ethnic and gender groups (Commonwealth Fund, 1997). This survey noted that many of these girls waited until symptoms of mental health problems, such as depression, reached crisis levels before seeking treatment (Commonwealth Fund, 1997).</p>

		<h5>Summary</h5>
		<p>The previous section provided a brief, surface-level snapshot of some of the issues and concerns facing Asian American women, families and communities. The problems described were meant to highlight how Asian American women's fundamental human rights are compromised through violence, sexual and labor exploitation, and barriers to access the welfare, health care and other systems. Foo (2002) states that "?only empowered Asian American women can make lasting changes in their communities and beyond?grassroots organizing and base-building efforts are crucial" (p.7). There is significant evidence for the need for community organizing efforts by and on behalf of Asian American women.</p>

		<h3>Overview of Community Organizing</h3>
		<p>Community organizing is a means to address the problems resulting from continuing race, class and gender inequities and tensions in the United States.  It broadens the gaze beyond the individual to the community and broader systems levels. In addition, evidence suggests that social involvement and participation, which are components of community organizing, can improve people's perceived control, individual coping capacity, health behaviors and health status (Minkler, 1998). In this section, I will present a definition of community organizing, a brief history of its origins, and explore key theoretical and conceptual bases.</p>

		<p>Community organizing can be defined as a process through which communities are helped to identify common problems or goals, mobilize resources, and develop and implement strategies for reaching the goals they collectively have set (Alinsky, 1972; Minkler, 1998; Hope & Timmel, 1984). Key tenets of community organizing include the idea that communities are strengthened when their resources and skills are increased, and that the needs or problems around which community groups are organized must be identified by the community itself, not by an outside organization or change agent (Alinsky, 1972; Minkler,1998; Hope & Timmel, 1984). Community organizing involves "?the process that builds a constituency that can go on to create a movement, and it occurs at a level between the micro-mobilization of individuals and the 'political process' of the broader social system" (Stall & Stoecker, 1998, p. 732). Although usually thought of in geographic terms, a community may also be defined by shared interests or characteristics, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or occupation.</p>

		<p>The term 'community organizing' was first used in the late 1800s by American social workers who were coordinating services for newly arrived immigrants and the poor (Haynes & Mickelson, 2003; Minkler, 1998). These early approaches to community organizing within the field of social work focused on helping communities self-identify and increase their problem-solving abilities. Several important milestones in the history of community organizing also took place outside the realm of social work (Minkler, 1998). For example, African Americans organized in the late 1800s to try to reclaim newly won rights that were slipping away during the post Civil War time period. Also in the late 1800s, the Populist movement began as an agrarian revolution and became a major coalition and political force. Additionally, the labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s, and the global liberation struggles of people of color in the 1950s, all served as essential antecedents to contemporary community organizing efforts (Minkler, 1998; Stall & Stoecker, 1998).</p>

		<p>In the 1950s, a new model of community organizing, most closely identified with Saul Alinsky, was gaining momentum. This new model, often referred to as 'social action organizing,' stressed confrontation and conflict strategies for redressing power imbalances (Alinsky, 1972, Minkler, 1998). In order to bring about social change, outside organizers would help to create dissatisfaction with the status quo among the disenfranchised, build a sense of community identity, and work with members to identify winnable goals and nonviolent conflict strategies and other methods to bring about change (Haynes & Mickelson, 2003; Minkler, 1998). Alinksy's model of organizing is based on a conception of separate public and private spheres and is considered to be 'male-dominated' in its teaching models and practice (Stall & Stoecker, 1998).</p>

		<p>In contrast, the women-centered model of organizing criticizes the split between public and private, and organizing efforts are rooted in private sphere issues. With a focus on building relationships and empowering individuals through those relationships, this model is often thought to have originated as a result of African American women's efforts to sustain home and community under slavery (Ackelsberg, 1988; Gutierrez, 1990; Gutierrez & Lewis, 1994; hooks, 1990; Stall & Stoecker, 1998). Community building, collectivism, caring, mutual respect, and self-transformation are emphasized in this model (Stall & Stoecker, 1998). Women-centered organizing includes organizing to secure tenants rights, local daycares, youth programs, or any efforts to alter living conditions or policies that threaten women's families and communities (Gutierrez & Lewis, 1994; Pardo, 1995).</p>

		<p>More recently, Bradshaw, Soifer and Gutierrez (1993) proposed a "hybrid model" of organizing in communities of color that combines aspects of the Alinsky approach with relevant perspectives from feminist organizing. This hybrid model emphasizes the importance of flexibility, leadership identification and training, collaborative and confrontational tactics, and the role of organizer as a learner and facilitator (Bradshaw, Soifer, & Gutierrez, 1993; Gutierrez & Lewis, 1994; Minkler, 1998). Another significant component of organizing addressed by this model is the development of cultural competence by the organizer in order to better understand, interact with, and learn from the community (Bradshaw, Soifer, & Gutierrez, 1993; Gutierrez & Lewis, 1994; Minkler, 1998).</p>

		<p>Historically, Asian American women have been involved in organizing that transcends "ideal type constructs" such as the Alinsky model, the women-centered model, and other specifically-defined approaches to organizing (Stall & Stoecker, 1998). As a result, I will use a general definition of community organizing as:</p>

		<blockquote>The process of building power that includes people with a problem in defining their community, defining the problems that they wish to address, the solutions they wish to pursue, and the methods they will use to accomplish their solutions (Stall & Stoecker, 1998, p.731).</blockquote>

		<p>This definition is broad and relevant to the Alinsky model, the women-centered model, and other approaches to organizing.</p>

		<h5>Asian American Women and Community Organizing</h5>
		<blockquote>Our own remarkable acts of resistance - as plantation workers, railroad crews, miners, factory operatives, cannery workers, farmers, garment workers, shopkeepers, "ethnic entrepreneurs," union organizers, student activists, writers and artists, cultural critics, and radical academicians - remain invisible, even to ourselves (Aguilar-San Juan, 1994, p. 6).</blockquote>

		<p>Historically, there were numerous legal and social barriers that inhibited an Asian American presence in institutional, political, and social spheres. However, since 1989 when the groundbreaking anthology Making Waves: An Anthology of Writings by and About Asian American Women was published, more narratives about the organizing and resistance efforts of Asian American women in spite of these multiple barriers, have emerged. I will offer some very brief snapshots of these organizing and resistance efforts, but first I want to acknowledge the noticeable absence of information around Asian American women's organizing around queer issues and around issues for those living with disabilities. My hope is that more of these narratives will be unearthed and explored in the future so that they may also be incorporated in future research studies and discussions on Asian American women and community organizing.</p>

		<p>The types of formal and informal organizing efforts that Asian American women were historically involved in were very much linked to the sociopolitical climate and immigration laws of the period. The first wave of Asian women's organizing occurred in the 1960s, enabled by a change to immigration laws that allowed more Asian women into the United States and inspired by the civil rights movement, the women's movement and the anti-Vietnam War movement (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000). During this period, formal groups such as Asian Women United in San Francisco, Asian Sisters In Action in Boston, and other more informal networks of primarily professional East Asian American women focused on empowering Asian women in economic, social and political spheres (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000). However, many of the ideas and concerns of leftist Asian women in Yellow Power and other Asian American groups such as refugees and low-income immigrants were marginalized (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Zia, 2000).</p>

		<p>As a result of immigration policies after 1965, the influx of highly educated and affluent Asian immigrants led to the creation of large organizations of primarily middle-class East Asian women (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Zia, 2000). These women's groups tended to work on education and service projects rather than challenging social and economic injustices. Often conservative and mainstream institutions supported these "model minority" activities because they juxtaposed Asian Americans as the "good" minority in opposition to the "bad" minorities, African Americans and Latinos (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Zia, 2000). In discussing the involvement of more educated and middle class women in organizing, Chow (1989) suggested that "to some extent, political participation may be a class privilege for women who have the luxury of time, money, and energy" (p. 363).</p>

		<p>Emerging from the 1980s multicultural movements, the second wave of organizing included many ethnically specific support networks that developed into women's groups (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000). Over time, many of these groups became involved in the battered women's movement, including Manavi in New Jersey, Sneha in Hartford, and the New York Asian Women's Center, which offer hotlines and shelter for battered Asian American women (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Shah, 1997;  Zia, 2000). Other Asian American women also became involved in the women of color and lesbian/gay liberation movements.</p>

		<p>Several national Asian American advocacy organizations that have been led by Asian American women include the Asian Pacific Islander American Health Forum, the Asian American Pacific Community Health Organizations, the National Asian Pacific American Families Against Substance Abuse, the Japanese American Citizens League, and the Organization of Chinese Americans (Louie, 2000). These Asian American women leaders have played significant roles in defining issues, formulating policy and promoting social change. Examples of more recent community-based organizing efforts in Asian American communities include the work of trailblazing non-profit organizations like Asian Immigrant Women Advocates (AIWA) in California and CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities (also known as Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence) in New York, and a brief description of the work of these organizations will be provided below.</p>

		<p>Founded in 1983, AIWA organizes and strives to empower women workers employed in the garment, hotel, restaurant, electronics assembly and other low-wage industries through education, leadership development and collective action (AIWA's History, (n.d.); Omatsu, 1994). One of AIWA's landmark grassroots organizing campaigns was the Garment Workers Justice Campaign that was launched in 1992 (AIWA's History, (n.d.); Omatsu, 1994). In this campaign, Asian immigrant seamstresses and supporters around the country conducted high-profile demonstrations in order to demand corporate responsibility from garment manufacturers such as Jessica McClintock, Inc. In 1996, AIWA signed an agreement with Jessica McClintock, Inc. that created worker protections for garment workers in the San Francisco Bay Area (AIWA's History, (n.d.); Omatsu, 1994). Building on the momentum of their first victory, AIWA went on to create agreements with Espirit de Corp., Byer California and Fritzi of California that addressed the concerns of garment workers (AIWA's History, (n.d.); Omatsu, 1994). Since then AIWA has developed other programs that focus on women's leadership, health and safety issues, and youth training and leadership.</p>

		<p>Founded in 1986 by Asian women, and led by members of low-income Asian immigrant communities, CAAAV Organizing Asian Communities works to combat anti-Asian violence by mobilizing Asian communities and building coalitions (About CAAAV, (n.d.)). CAAAV focuses on issues such as worker exploitation, concentrated urban poverty, police brutality, Immigration Naturalization Service detention and deportation, the criminalization of youth workers, and other issues that affect immigrant, poor and working-class communities. Examples of CAAAV's programs include the Women Workers Project, which organizes Asian women workers, particularly domestic workers, and the Chinatown Justice Project, which serves to unite low-income residents of Chinatown in Manhattan to fight for decent and affordable housing and to challenge displacement caused by gentrification (About CAAAV, (n.d.)).</p>

		<p>Karin Aguilar-San Juan, writer, activist and editor of The State of Asian America: Activism and Resistance in the 1990s states that in the past three decades there have been many examples of Asian American activists, organizers, scholars, writers and artists who have committed their lives to combating exploitation and racism, sexism, homophobia, environmental destruction, media stereotypes, domestic violence, hate crimes, police repression and U.S. imperialism. However, she notes that there is a lack of visible activist and resistance movement role models and narratives within Asian American communities and beyond (1994).</p>

		<h3>Choosing to Become a Community Organizer</h3>
		<blockquote>...political activism is the first step toward becoming visible, eradicating the stereotype of passivity, and challenging the condition of namelessness. (Chow, 1989, p. 375).</blockquote>

		<p>The decision to participate in community organizing efforts on a long-term basis is not likely to be a one-step process, but rather a complex decision that involves an array of psychological, cultural, social and group processes. I would like to examine this phenomenon more specifically by combining the contributions of community organizing and feminist psychology with the sociopolitical, developmental and systemic contexts of racial/ethnic identity development theories. How do gender dynamics and race and ethnicity interact to influence an Asian American woman's decision to become a community organizer? And how in turn does community organizing work impact an Asian American woman's gender role, ethnicity and sense of self? This section serves to propose answers to these questions.</p>

		<h5>Community Organizing, Empowerment and Theories of Change</h5>
		<p>The literature on community organizing and social action tends to emphasize the importance of education as a strategy for mobilizing individuals and communities to transform their realities. Education in this context often includes an emphasis on critical reflection, dialogue and praxis (Freire, 1973; Freire, 1970). These strategies are based on the ground-breaking work of Brazilian educator Paulo Freire, which has inspired several community-based programs around the world.</p>

		<p>Freire asserted that the goal of education is to help people challenge the status quo and the conditions that keep them powerless (Freire, 1973; Freire, 1970). To that end, his work promotes participation in critical reflection, or 'conscientization', a call for the individual to analyze the societal context for personal problems and their own role in changing those conditions (Freire, 1973; Freire, 1970). Freire suggested that this process happens through dialogue, the goal of which is praxis, or the ongoing interaction between reflection and people's actions to work towards individual and community change. Freire's central premise that people need to be subjects of their own learning who engage in active dialogue and ongoing reflection in order to begin and sustain social change efforts, continues to serve as a conceptual basis for many organizing efforts around the world (Freire, 1973; Freire, 1970; Minkler, 1998)</p>

		<h5>Feminist Therapies</h5>
		<p>In a discussion of factors leading someone to participate in organizing efforts, it is also important to address the contributions of feminist thought as they link social activism with profound individual, group and societal changes. Emerging from the civil rights and social change movements of the 1960s, feminist therapies contend that women are an oppressed group in U.S. society, that gender is a central organizing aspect in an individual's life, and that lasting individual change is only possible in combination with systemic changes that empower women living in a patriarchal society. In describing the goals of feminist therapies, Evans, Kincade, Marbley & Seem (2005) write:</p>

		<blockquote>feminist practitioners work with clients to achieve less quantifiable outcomes such as improved self-esteem, improved quality of life, gender role flexibility, and involvement in social action, and awareness of oppression and socialization (p. 272).</blockquote>

		<p>Feminist therapy incorporates a broad range of theoretical and therapeutic practice, and core components include consciousness raising, social and gender role analysis and social activism (Brown, 1994; Comas-Diaz & Greene, 1994; Evans, Kincade, Marbley, Seem & 2005). Similar to the process of conscientization described by Freire, in the 1960s consciousness-raising groups were a forum for women to come together to discuss and analyze their positions in an oppressive society and to brainstorm strategies for social change (Brown, 1994; Comas-Diaz & Greene, 1994; Evans, Kincade, Marbley, Seem, 2005). Various studies have shown that women who participated in consciousness raising groups, both non-therapy and therapy groups, responded positively to the experience. For example, results of a study by Kravetz et al (1987) indicated that female participants in a consciousness raising group reported feeling more capable of solving personal difficulties and internalized feminist values through participation. Similarly, in DiClemente and Prochaska's (1982) transtheoretical model of change, often used in treatment for substance abuse, consciousness raising is a core process that helps the client move from a stage of precontemplation to contemplation, where she is willing to acknowledge and evaluate her difficulties in the context of oppressive systems.</p>

		<p>Feminist therapies also discuss the role of social activism as a necessary endeavor to improve women's lives and as a potentially healing activity for the individual who engages in social change efforts. In her influential book on trauma, Judith Herman (1997) wrote about the role of social action in healing from sexual trauma:</p>

		<blockquote>Social action offers the survivor a source of power that draws upon her own initiative, energy, and resourcefulness but that magnifies these qualities far beyond her own sustained capacities. ? It brings out the best in her; in return, the survivor gains a sense of connection with the best in other people" (p. 207-208).</blockquote>

		<p>Herman also suggests that activism has a positive impact on the individual in addition to offering benefits through connections with others, and this relational focus is another significant theme in feminist thought.</p>

		<p>Self-in-relation theory is a feminist psychodynamic model of female developmental theory that contends that "like any subjugated group, women have tended to form intense affiliations and relationships with other women in the workplace, the community, and the family" (Berzoff, Melano, Flanagan & Hertz, 1996, p. 253). Self-in-relation theorists suggest that relationships are a source of power and effectiveness and that relational bonds foster identity development (Berzoff, Melano, Flanagan & Hertz, 1996; Jordan & Surrey, 1986; Miller & Stiver, 1997). In discussing self-in-relation theory, Berzoff, Melano, Flanagan & Hertz assert that relationships serve as a way for women "to act and react from their subordinate positions" while "fostering their identities and leading to stronger senses of self" (1996, p.253).</p>

		<p>Related to the theme of relationships as crucial components of women's identity development and sense of self, research studies have demonstrated the importance of connectedness, mutuality and empowerment as motivating factors for social action among women of color. In her study on Asian American women and social advocacy, Louie (2000) found the rewards of social advocacy for Asian American women to include meeting others who hold similar attitudes and values leading to an increased sense of affiliation and self-worth. She also noted that these women sustained their commitment to social advocacy through social networks and collegial relationships that developed in the course of the advocacy activities. Similarly, Lazzari, Ford, and Haughey (1996) conducted a study on Hispanic women who were active in their communities and suggested that relationships, particularly with family, role models and mentors, motivated and positively contributed to their experiences of being active in the community (Lazzari, Ford, & Haughey, 1996).</p>

		<p>Another emergent theme in feminist literature related to the impact of consciousness raising and social activism is the process of claiming knowledge and becoming visible by finding voice through relationships with others (Denison, 1995; Hartman, 1987; Lorde, 1984; Miller & Stiver, 1997). Audre Lorde, a Black lesbian poet and activist, has written about the risks involved in gaining knowledge and challenging the 'truths' that maintain an oppressive society, including fear of censure, judgment, confrontation or even annihilation (Lorde, 1984). She comments on the importance of speaking out while developing relationships with others with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>My silence had not protected me. Your silence will not protect you. But for every real word spoken, for every attempt I had ever made to speak those truths for which I am still seeking, I had made contact with other women while we examined the words to fit a world in which we all believed, bridging our differences (Lorde, 1984, p. 41).</blockquote>

		<p>In addition, the significance of finding voice, the process of telling one's story and being believed, has also been shown to be a source of empowerment and healing for survivors of sexual trauma (Sutton-Ryan, 1998).</p>

		<p>Pulling this together, based on the existing literature, one could hypothesize that community organizing work, by definition a relationship-focused approach, may positively impact an Asian American woman's identity and sense of self by providing a forum for her to remain relationally connected while potentially claiming knowledge, finding a voice and/or experiencing mutuality. In the past 10 to 15 years, through the contributions of women of color, feminist therapies have increasingly recognized the interconnected effects of race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, physical ability and region in women's lives and the problems with considering gender separately, and continued efforts in this direction are crucial for development in this field (Evans, Kincade, Marbley, Seem, 2005; Kim, L.M., 2001). Since an Asian American woman's experience of gender oppression cannot be isolated from her experience as a racial and ethnic minority in the United States, in the next section I will explore racial/ethnic identity development theories as they pertain to Asian Americans.</p>

		<h5>Racial/Ethnic Identity Development Theories</h5>
		<p>Racial/ethnic identity models attempt to explain the ways in which individuals living in a racist society ultimately develop a healthy conception of themselves within a racial context (Helms, 1995; Kim, J., 2001; Phinney, 1990; Yeh & Huang, 1996). The first models were developed to describe the racial identity development of African Americans, but later theorists expanded the theory to address the racial experiences of other ethnic and racial groups living in the U.S., including White Americans (Helms, 1995; Kim, J., 2001; Phinney, 1990; Yeh & Huang, 1996). Kim (2001) has developed as Asian American Identity Development (AAID) model that offers insight into how Asian Americans may negotiate this process.</p>

		<p>Kim's (2001) five stage model towards acquiring a positive Asian American racial identity is sequential in nature, but Kim notes that the process is not linear or automatic and it is possible for individuals to become stuck in a certain stage. Many social and environmental factors influence the progression towards a positive Asian American racial identity, and Kim (2001) asserts that Asian Americans tend to be more sensitive to the expectations of the group and their social environment than the majority White population, and thus Asian American identity development is especially affected by the social environment.</p>

		<p>In the AAID model, discrimination and racism may lead to a racial identity conflict with varying degrees of severity. In describing the potential effects of this conflict, Kim states that an Asian American may experience identity conflict:</p>

		<blockquote>...as a belief in his or her own inferiority (as well as the inferiority of other Asian Americans) perhaps coupled with deep-seated feelings of self-hatred and alienation?experiences of denial and/or rejection of their Asian heritage contribute towards Asian Americans' negative self-concept and low self-esteem (2001, p. 70).</blockquote>

		<p>Thus the underlying assumptions of the AAID model are that White racism cannot be separated from Asian American identity development, that changing one's negative racial identity involves a conscious decision to unlearn internalized racism, and that acquiring a positive racial identity is integrally connected to the psychological well-being of Asian Americans (Kim, J., 2001).</p>

		<p>The first stage Kim (2001) writes about is called Ethnic Awareness. The critical factor of this stage is the extent of participation in Asian ethnic activities, and people in this stage are generally in the process of discovering their ethnic heritage. The AAID model suggests that greater participation in Asian ethnic activities leads to a positive self-concept and a more clear sense of being a person of Asian heritage, while less participation may lead to a neutral self-concept and a less clear sense of being a person of Asian heritage.</p>

		<p>Stage two is called White Identification, which can happen in an active or passive way. The critical factor at this point is increased contact with White society which leads to acceptance of White values and standards. This stage is marked by negative self-image, feelings of being different, alienation from the self and other Asian Americans, and the inability to make connections between personal experiences and racism. The next stage of the AAID model is Awakening to Social Political Consciousness. The critical factor at this stage is gaining political consciousness related to being a racial/political minority and gaining an awareness of White racism. During this stage, Asian Americans develop a more positive self-concept as they gain new political perspectives and 'sociological imagination', and often people in this stage feel politically alienated from Whites (Kim, 2001, p. 68). In describing the role of political involvement for Asian Americans at this stage, Kim suggests that social action offers opportunities to:</p>

		<blockquote>find meaningful support systems and a new paradigm, which enables them to reinterpret their past negative experiences of personal shame and take ownership of their identities in light of the societal illness called racism (2001, p. 78).</blockquote>

		<p>Kim (2001) describes stage four as Redirection to an Asian American Consciousness. At this point, people immerse themselves in experiences of being Asian American, and there is a focus on personal and Asian American issues, and often people feel anger against Whites about the treatment of Asian Americans. At this point, Asian Americans have developed a positive self-concept and they feel pride in being Asian American and they experience a sense of belonging. The last stage of the AAID model is called Incorporation. In this stage, Kim (2001) states that Asian Americans have a clear and firm Asian American identity but they are able to blend this identity with the rest of their identities and think of themselves as a "whole person with race as only a part of their social identity" (p. 81).</p>

		<p>In summary, in the AAID model there is a general progression from an unexamined racial/ethnic identity characterized by a lack of attention to ethnicity and underlying preference for the dominant culture, to an ethnic identity search involving immersion in the culture of origin that may involve a rejection of dominant cultural values, and finally to an ethnic/racial identity achievement characterized by an appreciation for the individual's race/ethnicity and resolution of conflicts with the dominant group. Once individuals reach the last stage of Kim's (2001) model, Incorporation, they are supposedly confident in their identities and aware of the manifestations of oppression, but it is unclear to what degree they continue to collude or alternatively to resist colluding with systems of oppression. If there is a resolution of conflicts with the dominant group, does this also lead to acceptance of the status quo?</p>

		<p>Other questions are raised by the fact that the AAID model suggests the primacy of race and racism in the lives of Asian Americans and it fails to acknowledge variations in racial/ethnic identity development as a result of gender discrimination, homophobia and other oppressions. Studies have shown that for some women of color, participation in social change efforts is linked to their racial/ethnic identities and their identities as women. In Louie's (2000) study on Asian American women and social advocacy, the author used open-ended questions and found that her respondents described their social advocacy work as integral to their identities as Asian American women. She noted the pivotal role of experiencing or witnessing injustices as a factor that led them to increase their awareness of social injustices, particularly among Asian American groups. Similarly, Abrahams (1996) conducted a study of predominantly middle class Latina women who participated in community empowerment work in the Latino community in East Los Angeles. Abrahams (1996) found that for many of these volunteers community participation provided a connection to their cultural backgrounds and a resource for "entrenching a Latina identity" (Abrahams, 1996, p. 776).</p>

		<p>The literature on racial/ethnic identity development suggests that an Asian American woman's experience of her race/ethnicity may influence her sense of self, her choice of activities and level of immersion within her community, and the degree to which she may challenge the racist social structure.</p>

		<h3>Literature Review Summary and Implications</h3>
		<p>The literature I have chosen to present in the previous sections has led me to conceptualize three distinct phases of development for an Asian American female organizer. First, the process of choosing to organize, which could be stimulated by consciousness-raising activities, ongoing racial/ethnic or feminist identity development, key relationships, and/or other factors working individually or together. The second phase involves the impact of the work on the organizer as it may influence her identity and/or psychological and social functioning through the development of collegial relationships, mutuality, development of a voice, and/or other factors. Finally, in the third phase one could assess the long-term process of sustaining oneself in the field and recruiting others. This synthesis of important perspectives in feminist thought, racial/ethnic identity development theories and community organizing literature raises many questions for exploration.</p>

		<h3>The Present Study</h3>
		<p>In this study, my aim is to learn more about the new generation of Asian American women who are involved in community organizing efforts. There appear to be many structural barriers that could potentially hinder Asian American women from engaging in the type of activities that are involved in community organizing work, including the impact of oppression by gender and race and the challenges of negotiating a bi- or multicultural environment. As a result, I would like to explore the themes among the individual, interpersonal, institutional and cultural variables that interact when an Asian American woman makes the choice to become a community organizer and remain in this work. What resources have these women needed to become community organizers given the mental health needs and other issues discussed previously?  What resources help them remain engaged in this work? These are the ideas under exploration in this study.</p>
