		<h1>Findings</h1>

		<p>In this chapter, the main findings of the study will be reviewed and presented in three sections. The first section provides a discussion of the data gathered related to the life experiences that led participants to first participate in organizing efforts. This is followed by an exploration of the impact of organizing on participants' identity development and sense of self. In the final section, participant responses to a question about suggestions for recruiting and supporting current and future generations of Asian American women in community organizing have been compiled.</p>

		<h3>Life Experiences Leading to Participation in Organizing Efforts</h3>
		<p>This section explores the themes that emerged when participants were asked about the experiences and the factors that first led them to participate in community organizing efforts. The major influences identified by these women included: (1) experiences of oppression, (2) significant relationships and (3) exposure to information through formal education, and thus this section with be further divided into three sub-sections that highlight those themes. These factors were addressed as working both individually and in interaction with each other to impact these women's decisions to take action around social justice issues. Significant events were described as the content for later politicization. Quotes will be used to illustrate the themes but will not be prefaced with any identifying information in order to protect the confidentiality of the participants. Names are loaded with meanings, from family histories, sociocultural and political histories, religious backgrounds, class or caste, and other variables. As a result, the researcher has chosen not to include even pseudonyms before the quotes in this chapter.</p>

		<h5>Experiences of Oppression</h5>
		<p>Given the racial and gender minority status of the participants, it was not surprising that all of the women in this study were greatly impacted by personally experiencing or observing oppression. All of the participants described an experience of oppression, whether directed towards the self, witnessed, or a combination of both, as one of the major influences that led them to first participate in community organizing efforts. Most of the women described multiple experiences of oppression. These experiences were diverse, ranging from domestic violence in the participants' family of origin, to being the victim of racial harassment in school, to feeling misunderstood by service providers. All of these experiences of oppression were described as difficult, and often extremely painful.</p>

		<p>In addition, these experiences underscored the ways in which racism, sexism, heterosexism, ageism and other oppressions intersect in the lives of Asian American women. This theme was addressed directly by 50% (n =10) of participants, as highlighted by one participant who stated, "I made a connection between being marginalized as a woman, as an Asian woman, and as a queer woman and that led me to organizing." Similarly, two participants described the process of becoming more conscious about the intersections of oppressions through organizing. One participant reported, "I was always very conscious of the intersections of both race, gender and sexual orientation, and lately I'm trying to become more conscious about class." In like manner, another participant said, "My experiences around race also had to do with my being a woman, I needed to add a gender analysis." Nicely summarizing the overarching theme that emerged in the majority of narratives, one study participant stated, "I've been aware of a lot of injustice at a lot of different levels - racism, sexism, ageism, etc., who I am today as active in the community is because of this awareness."</p>

		<p>The experiences of oppression described by participants will be described in more depth under five broad categories: personal experiences of racism, observed racism, sexism, homophobia and heterosexism and ageism. As discussed above, it was clear from the narratives that the intersections of these variables in reality was deep and complex, and therefore the choice to divide the descriptions of these experiences into different categories runs the risk of over-simplifying. Some of the chosen quotes would more appropriately fit under all subheadings. In spite of these limitations, this format was chosen in order to include more participant quotes and to make it easier for the reader to grasp the major themes.</p>

		<h5>Racism (20/20; 100%)</h5>
		<p>All of the participants described at least one experience of racism, either directed to the self or observed, that fostered their interest in beginning community organizing work. In terms of racism directed toward the self, 80% (n =16) of participants described such experiences, and these have been categorized under three broad themes: childhood environments, interactions with institutions and an emotional response to being the victim of racism. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these three themes.</p>

		<h6>Racism encountered in childhood environments (16/20; 80%).</h6>
		<p>In responding to the question about the factors that led her to first participate in organizing efforts, one participant described an early experience of racism by saying, "We were the only two people of color in my whole school and we had a lot of problems with the racism in the South, and so that I think sparked my interest in social justice work." Another participant gave the following example that highlights racism related to the immigration experience:</p>

		<blockquote>I think it started from just that experience of having been born in what is considered more of a developing nation and then taken out of there and being adopted by a White family in a first-world nation. And then the experience of growing up that way so that the loss of my culture and my language and my family, all that kind of stuff, on top of then the racism that my brother and I experienced growing up and then not having a community to support us in processing that.</blockquote>

		<p>Additionally, one participant described her early experiences of racism as a woman who self-identifies as mixed by stating, "Mixed race experience is one that is very much about physical appearance and phenotypes, and growing up without anyone talking about issues the only thing I knew about being mixed was that I got a lot of comments about my looks from strangers."</p>

		<h6>Racism encountered in interactions with institutions (15/20; 75%).</h6>
		<p>One participant described a traumatic early experience involving multiple levels of service providers:</p>

		<blockquote>I'm an incest survivor and having to prosecute my Dad when I was 13? from the social workers who came to visit, to the police officers that interviewed me, to the therapist, to the prosecutors, nobody was really culturally-competent. They gave the excuse that this happens in 'your culture' - people actually said this to me directly.</blockquote>

		<p>A similar example of institutional racism that highlights the difficulties faced by Asian Americans was described by a participant who said:</p>

		<blockquote>When we first arrived in [U.S. state]?they tested me and I flunked all their tests and like cried and screamed the whole time and they told my dad that I was mentally challenged and my dad was like she's not mentally challenged she speaks and writes Chinese just fine, I don't know what you're talking about. My mom and dad had been teaching me Mandarin and all that at home but probably my English skills were lacking, but [school administrators] didn't really have an understanding of immigrants, at all, so they said, 'she has to go into a special education program.'</blockquote>

		<h6>Emotional response to experiencing racism (15/20; 75%).</h6>
		<p>In responding to the question about the factors that led to their initial participation in organizing efforts, participants also described a variety of emotional responses to experiencing racism. For example, one participant said, "Because I was afraid, and angry also. The fear of being mistreated, the fear for my safety." In like manner, another participant stated, "I guess I was angry too at being treated differently."</p>

		<p>In addition, 100% (n =20) of participants described powerful experiences of observing racism around them, and these experiences have been categorized under three broad themes: family of origin, institutional racism and volunteerism. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these three themes.</p>

		<h6>Observing racism impacting family of origin (14/20; 70%).</h6>
		<p>Many participants described observing racism affecting their immediate families and neighborhoods. One participant said, "I saw the suffering my parents had to endure because they couldn't speak the language and they had to rely on their children." Similarly, another participant highlighted class issues in describing her experiences with the following, "My family were very poor when they first immigrated?images of really poor immigrants played a part in my ending up doing organizing around issues of community and class." A third participant made a connection between her family and dynamics in the neighborhood, she said, "I knew I wanted to work in the neighborhoods I grew up in and address a lot of the disconnects that I saw being Chinese American and the daughter of immigrants."</p>

		<h6>Observing Institutional racism (10/20; 50%).</h6>
		<p>In responding to the question about the factors that led her to first participate in organizing efforts, one participant gave the following summary of her experiences of institutional racism:</p>

		<blockquote>I saw how a lot of people didn't understand how things work and they couldn't communicate. When the system doesn't change to accommodate for diverse ethnic communities then you really can't have people fully participating in mainstream culture. And so that really prompted me to say, hey, I have these skills I can use to help my community and make these changes.</blockquote>

		<p>Another participant described observing institutional racism with the following: "Because I'm biracial I think that I pass really easily, unintentionally?I've seen a lot of institutional racism more than individual racism."</p>

		<h6>Volunteerism providing exposure to racist conditions (2/20; 10%).</h6>
		<p>Two participants described witnessing racist conditions while engaged in volunteer activities as a stimulus for participating in organizing efforts. One participant stated, "I started volunteering when I was younger. Doing community service I was exposed to a lot of people's problems and exposed to injustice and inequality at all levels."</p>

		<h5>Sexism (15/20; 75%)</h5>
		<p>Seventy-five percent (n =15) of participants described at least one experience of sexism, either directed to the self or observed, that led them to first participate in community organizing efforts. These experiences of sexism have been categorized under five broad themes: violence against women, feeling over-sexualized, feeling silenced, empathy and physical appearance. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these five themes.</p>

		<h6>Violence against women (12/20; 60%).</h6>
		<p>One participant described a key event involving violence against women that led to her participation in organizing:</p>

		<blockquote>At [undergraduate college] there was a communication to Asian women about a study done of sexual assault reports on campus and the director had correlated that there was almost a three-fold incidence of Asian women being assaulted? I decided to investigate this for my final project...</blockquote>

		<p>Another participant described being shaped by exposure to violence in her family of origin:</p>
		
		<blockquote>I was born into a family with domestic violence so I watched my mom being abused?I grew up in a family where there were five kids, four girls and one boy, and I felt that my brother was given preferential treatment and that was very upsetting to me, it was hurtful because I thought it wasn't fair and it made me feel that girls weren't valued as much as boys.</blockquote>

		<h6>Feeling over- sexualized (10/20; 50%).</h6>
		<p>Many participants described encountering stereotypes of Asian American women related to sexuality, for example, one participant said, "I felt very sexualized where I had gone to high school, as an Asian American woman and the only woman of color in the school." Demonstrating the complexity of sexism in terms of the multiple layers of influence, one participant stated, "You see sexism within your own community and your own family and then also in the outside community where that whole being exoticized and White men having Asian fetishes." Another participant described the trauma of being molested as a child by her first grade teacher and how this "opened [her] eyes to sexual violence of women."</p>

		<h6>Empathy (6/20; 30%).</h6>
		<p>Some participants described feeling a sense of solidarity with other women in the face of oppression, highlighted by the following quote by a participant:</p>

		<blockquote>Women are systematically oppressed in this society but different groups of women have different kinds of oppression, so that like just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I know how somebody feels in the Philippines who is being prostituted, I'm not going to know that, but the capacity to empathize or sympathize, not sure what the right word is, issues are bigger than me but I can try to understand what other women are going through and do something about it.</blockquote>

		<h6>Feeling silenced(4/20; 20%).</h6>
		<p>Four participants described the impact of sexism and feeling silenced as a catalyst for their participant in organizing. One participant gave the following example:</p>

		<blockquote>"There was this moment where I actually realized what it felt like to not be able to talk because I was a girl?I had to facilitate a small group and there were three guys and me? and they basically argued with each other the whole time? and I was really really angry because I felt like they didn't give a crap about what I said and they really just wanted to hear themselves talk."</blockquote>

		<h6>Physical appearance (3/20; 15%).</h6>
		<p>Another aspect of sexism mentioned by participants was physical appearance in terms of mass media images of feminine ideals of beauty. One participant said, "I don't really look like what society thinks that women should look and I don't really act like how society tells women to act and so people have a hard time with my gender." Another participant acknowledged her increasing awareness of privileges related to her physical appearance and societal standards by stating, "I became more conscious about privileges about how I look and act and dress and how I have more freedom as a woman who looks a certain way that society accepts that."</p>

		<h6>Homophobia and Heterosexism(6/20; 30%).</h6>
		<p>Thirty percent (n =6) of participants described at least one experience of homophobia and/heterosexism, either directed to the self or observed, that led them to first participate in community organizing efforts. These experiences of homophobia and/heterosexism were mainly the result of relationships with others, including family of origin, romantic partners and friends. Other participants discussed key relationships with others that raised their consciousness and stimulated a desire to take action, as illustrated by the following two quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>My partner is bisexual and I had to learn to use race as a lens to see the struggles of those who are homosexual and be really conscious of that and try to change that. One of my best friends was gay and from the same ethnic background and that didn't help him in terms of feeling open in the church tying salvation to something when he was very clear about who he was, so I decided to leave the church because of that, and that was a key moment.</blockquote>

		<h6>Ageism (6/20; 30%).</h6>
		<p>The literature review did not address issues of ageism, but 30% (n =6) of participants described at least one experience of ageism, either directed to the self or observed, that led them to first participate in community organizing efforts. One participant gave an example of ageism that she encountered prior to and during her organizing work. She said, "When you're young, people don't take you seriously in meetings and formal settings." Another participant described her experiences of ageism as related to aspects of Vietnamese culture that had both positive and negative implications for her:</p>

		<blockquote>"...in Vietnamese culture there is a hierarchy around gender and age? respect is a part of our culture? you really have to be sensitive being young, sensitive to the dynamics and interactions of people, and being female many times if you say things too strongly or aggressive it's not a trait that most people would say is positive in a female."</blockquote>

		<h6>Summary of the Impact of Experiences of Oppression.</h6>
		<p>As described in the literature (Aguilar San Juan, 1994; Asian Women United of California, 1989; Encarguez Perez, 2003; Foo, 2002; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000), it is not surprising that all of the Asian American women in this study experienced or witnessed some form of oppression, and that these experiences were powerful and often painful. As described by Kim (2001) in her third stage of Asian American ethnic identity development, these experiences of oppression seem to have awakened the participants to a social and political consciousness. Encompassing issues of race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and age, and encounters across the spectrum from personal relationships to institutions such as churches, colleges and the courts, these women were impacted by these challenging experiences of oppression in a myriad of ways that stimulated action.</p>

		<h5>Significant Relationships (19/20; 95%)</h5>
		<p>As predicted by the literature (Louie, 2000; Shah, 1997; Zia, 2000; Denison, 1995; Hartman, 2000; Lorde, 1984), 95% of participants (n =19) described at least one significant relationship as being one of the factors that led them to first participate in organizing efforts. Many of these women were directly motivated in the direction of organizing by the actions and values of their parents. They expressed a desire to model themselves after their caregivers. A majority of the women were also motivated by a desire for community and relationships with peers, teachers and others. The descriptions of significant relationships that impacted participants' desire to first participate in organizing efforts have been categorized under three broad themes: family of origin as role models, painful experiences in family of origin, and desire for community. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these three themes.</p>

		<h6>Family of origin as role models (10/20; 50%).</h6>
		<p>Many participants described the positive influence of their relationships in their family of origin as a factor impacting their choices to participate in organizing. Some participants described the character traits and values of family members, for example, one participant described, "?strong women in my family who didn't give up their fundamental beliefs and I watched my family come to this country and figure out how to live here, they were role models." Other participants discussed being directly influenced by the activities and career paths of family members, as demonstrated by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>My grandmother was a freedom fighter, a labor organizer, hardcore socialist, atheist and she didn't have an arranged marriage?I think who my grandma is in my life is a huge part of my organizing even though her views of politics and organizing is different than mine. She's inspiring about taboo-breaking and that it's ok to forge your own path even if it doesn't sit well with society around you.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>My father was an entrepreneur, always starting businesses and even as an immigrant man he was not afraid to take risks? My mother is more quiet but she ran the restaurant for 33 years, so I think it's in my blood to be a leader to be an organizer, to be ok to be alone to forge ahead. </blockquote>

		<blockquote>My mother has always been very active, and even my dad, in the community where we used to live in the Philippines. I would say she would probably be considered one of the pillars in the community, so I think that trickles down.</blockquote>

		<h6>Painful experiences in family of origin (5/20; 25%).</h6>
		<p>In contrast, some participants described traumatic experiences and/or ongoing challenges in their relationships with their family of origin as having an effect on their choices to participate in organizing efforts. One participant said, "I come from an alcoholic home, and I thought, 'I have bigger fish to fry', I need to get out of here." Another participant described the painful impact of being "born into a family with domestic violence so I watched my mom being abused." A third participant commented on the presence of ethnic community members during a challenging period in her family of origin with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>I'm an incest survivor? the reaction my mom faced when she decided to leave my father. Older people in the South Asian community intervened and had talks with her and said, 'why are you leaving him? You should never leave your husband.' And then we weren't invited to any parties anymore.</blockquote>

		<h6>Desire for Community (8/20; 40%).</h6>
		<p>Several participants linked their participation in organizing efforts to early feelings of isolation as a result of their racial and ethnic identities. One participant said, "When I grew up I definitely did not have a lot of exposure to other mixed people like me and other families like my own, and that resulted in a lot of isolation." Another participant said, "My feeling of being an outsider was essential to starting organizing work." Building on this theme of isolation, some participants described their discovery of organizing as a means to contextualize their sense of isolation and to develop a community. One participant said, "Not doing organizing meant I couldn't be around people who looked like me or talked like me or thought like me." A second participant described her experience with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>I grew up in a predominantly white neighborhood so there weren't many Filipinos in my neighborhood. So when I arrived at college in my first year and I met all these different Filipinos I was able to click with them instantly because of that Filipino identity.</blockquote>

		<p>Still another participant remarked on the power of the concept of community by stating:</p>

		<blockquote>I had never used the word before going to college? but once I decided to, I made it a personal and also a social concept to me and it was really empowering to feel like I was part of something that had resources and had strength that wasn't all about numbers and funding, and different ways I could play with that concept made me feel like I can organize.</blockquote>

		<h5>Exposure to information through formal education (7/20; 35%)</h5>
		<p>As predicted by the literature (Freire, 1970; Evans, Kincade, Marbley, Seem, 2005), 35% of participants (n =7) discussed how specific courses or educational experiences stimulated them to first participate in community organizing efforts.  A majority of these experiences took place in college settings and were met with strong emotions, ranging from anger, to sadness, to inspiration, and often as a combination of these. In addition, participants addressed the importance of learning history and a conceptual framework from which to understand the social inequities that they had experienced or observed. The descriptions of exposure to information through formal education that impacted participants' desire to first participate in organizing efforts have been categorized under three broad themes: development of a conceptual framework, importance of learning history, and emotional response to information. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these three themes.</p>

		<h6>Importance of learning history (7/20; 35%).</h6>
		<p>Some participants described the significance of learning about social and political movements and/or being exposed to previously invisible histories of marginalized groups. For example, one participant said, "I don't think any specific incident was a catalyst per se, actually maybe when I read my first article on the Korean comfort women, that made me really sad." Another participant described the importance of learning history in terms of her organizing with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>I was very drawn to the civil rights movement from the '50s and '60s, so I had studied that a little bit in high school on my own and then being in sociology and kind of writing my senior thesis on it, so I feel like somehow my experiences are related to that.</blockquote>

		<h6>Development of conceptual framework (5/20; 25%).</h6>
		<p>Similarly, some participants also spoke about specific courses or college programs that stimulated their interest in organizing work, as demonstrated by the following two quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>My major was Women's Studies... I think the idea that the feminist movement made, well the westernized one, that the personal is political really challenges the traditional concepts in academics and laid the grounds for my political work.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>My experience in freshman orientation in undergrad in a sense politicized me and then eventually radicalized me because it surprised me with a vocabulary to talk about all the things I had felt growing up? It introduced me to all these concepts like, oh wow, there's such a thing as power aside from military power, you know, or like there are power dynamics everywhere, and that in a sense told me that wow, you really can do something about it.</blockquote>

		<h6>Emotional response to information (5/20; 25%).</h6>
		<p>The following quote illustrates the type of emotional response that some participants underwent upon learning about social and political movements and/or being exposed to previously invisible histories of marginalized groups, beginning with anger and frustration leading to a desire for action:</p>

		<blockquote>I remember sitting in my class, I think it was Intro to Sociology, and I remember thinking 'how could I have been blind to all this blatant inequality?' I felt so angry and upset. And then I started thinking back to other experiences that were unfair or that were uncomfortable and I just sort of started thinking that? maybe there were deeper issues and I could do something about it, and that felt inspiring, like I could, and I needed to.</blockquote>

		<h5>Summary of Germinal Experiences that Led to Organizing</h5>
		<p>This study's findings about the factors that first led these twenty Asian American women to participate in organizing efforts illustrate a complex picture of intersecting and interacting factors. Participants experienced and observed social injustice and inequity. They learned about the gaps in school curricula while also being stimulated by the histories of oppression and resistance that they did learn about. In addition, relationships and connectedness to others played a key role. Participants spoke about familial role models and wanting to feel a sense of community, by race, ethnicity, gender and otherwise, as leading them to participate in organizing efforts. Also, participants mentioned strong emotional responses in their journeys towards organizing, including anger, fear, sadness, frustration, as well as inspiration and hope. The Asian American women in this study described their eventual organizing work as a gradual progression towards politicization and action stemming from a combination of the life experiences summarized above.</p>

		<h3>Impact of being a Community Organizer on Identity Development and Sense of Self</h3>
		<p>When asked about the impact of organizing on their identity development and sense of self, it was striking how all of the participants considered organizing to have had a tremendous impact on who they are today. Almost all participants felt that organizing stimulated a process of increasing their awareness and understanding of oppression and the social identities and privileges that result, thereby helping them integrate their own identities. In addition, these women described participation in organizing as something that made them feel good about themselves and feel more confident in expressing themselves. Participants also described organizing as increasing their feeling of belonging and affiliation to others. Organizing appears to have influenced how these women feel about themselves, how they feel about and interact with others, and how they express themselves to the world. The narratives have been broadly categorized into five themes: identity development, organizing as a component of identity, positive impact on sense of self, finding voice and feeling connected to others. Quotes have been selected to highlight these themes.</p>

		<h5>Identity development (19/20; 95%)</h5>
		<p>Almost all participants described organizing as playing a role in their identity development process, especially as related to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and other social identities. One participant said, "I didn't have a racial identity, I think that's what brought me to organizing first." A second participant described the impact of organizing on her identity development by stating, "I'm so much more conscious of race, and class, and sexism and all that stuff now than when I started. You have to be when you do this work." A third participant echoed this theme with the following:</p>
		
		<blockquote>I used to feel apologetic about my identity or need to legitimize myself, and now I realize that it's bullshit. [Organizing] made me feel even stronger that my ethnic identity and racial identity and various aspects of who I am are very important.</blockquote>

		<h5>Organizing as a component of identity (15/20; 75%)</h5>
		<p>Several participants described organizing as integral to the way they viewed themselves, with statements like, "I cannot imagine my future without some kind of organizing work being a part of it," and "I have to do this work. It's who I am," and, "It's so deeply ingrained in who I am I can't ignore it now even though before it was just wanting to get away from my alcoholic home."</p>

		<h5>Positive impact on sense of self (15/20; 75%)</h5>
		<p>Many participants described the ways that organizing positively influenced their sense of self, as demonstrated by participant responses such as, "I know that I walk with integrity," and "Helping people I also have to admit makes me feel good about myself"</p>

		<h5>Feeling connected to others (20/20; 100%)</h5>
		<p>Similarly, all of the participants indicated that organizing helped them feel more connected to other people, as demonstrated by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>The more you organize the more you learn about issues that go on around you, people's culture, traditions, experiences, anxieties, a lot of similarities in terms of feelings, and this decreases my aloneness. I identify with other people's issues, I feel connected to people.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>Feeling empowered personally? Making human connections with people who are oppressed systemically and seeing that I could make a difference in their lives made me feel like I'm doing something important.</blockquote>

		<h5>Finding voice (5/20; 25%)</h5>
		<p>Some participants also described how organizing influenced the process of finding their voice. One participant said, "I'm somebody who used to be really quiet. Organizing has really helped me to find a voice for others first and now I'm somewhere in the process of owning that voice for me."A second participant described the influence of organizing as "positively reinforcing my ideals and goals. I can be more self-expressive." A third participant described how organizing impacted her ability to speak out with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>It's helped me speak up, not to be passive about things, no one will help you, you need to make others aware of the issues facing you, the more allies you gain, the easier to get policies changed and your voice heard.</blockquote>

		<h3>Factors that Support and Sustain Participation in Organizing Efforts</h3>
		<p>When participants were asked about the factors that supported them in their work and their ideas for recruiting and supporting future generations of Asian American women in community organizing efforts, participants offered a comprehensive list of suggestions based on their own personal experiences and/or their observations as organizers. Many of these suggestions related to the experiences they shared as stimulating their own interest in organizing work, namely those that focus on relationships and education. Participants also described those things that would have facilitated their own organizing work, such as formal support structures and leadership development. Participant suggestions have been organized into ten themes: mentoring, self-care, formal support structures, raising awareness and visibility, outreach, career recruitment, duplicating successful models, volunteerism, professional development, and financial incentives. Quotes have been selected to illustrate these themes.</p>

		<h5>Mentoring (19/20; 95%)</h5>
		<p>Almost all participants advocated for mentoring as means of recruiting and sustaining Asian American women in community organizing. One participant said, "...you have to mentor, we need role models", and another participant added that "I guess it would be better to start younger, by the time they're in law school they know who they are and what they want to do." Emphasizing the need for Asian American role models for youth, one participant said:</p>

		<blockquote>I think it's really important to expose young people to these issues early and provide them with examples of Asian American women who are successful, people who make changes in their communities and benefit communities and to expose them to different people.</blockquote>

		<h5>Self-care (15/20; 75%)</h5>
		<p>Another common theme was self-care as echoed in responses such as, "We need to put the community back in community organizing by doing stuff for each other also" and "We need to learn to take better care of ourselves." Some participants described some of the challenges of organizing and offered feedback on the need for additional self-care options, as demonstrated by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>I don't know what that looks like, whether its like funding streams for retreats for women who are doing this kind of work or funding for women to be able to build communities that kind of support each other, 'cuz I feel like when we do this work we all kinda get separated and you don't have time to mentor other people, you don't have time to build relationships with other women because you get so immersed in the community that you're working with.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>We need to give people a sabbatical... just to take them out of the community organizing world, let them go to a spa, let them go to a writing retreat, something so they can be more energized to do the work that they do.</blockquote>

		<h5>Formal support structures (15/20; 75%)</h5>
		<p>Similarly, several participants commented on the need to develop formal support structures for Asian American female organizers, with responses such as, "We almost need to create formal groups to process what it is like to do this work and how it's shifting how we feel about ourselves," and "We could use a space for people to cultivate some sort of trust and have some sort of a support group or having a weekly space with each other." Another participant echoed this theme with the following comment specifically about spaces for women:</p>

		<blockquote>I feel like women's circles or women's support groups are so useful, at least they've been really useful for me to kind of push me beyond my comfort zone, number one, and to be with other women who 'get it'. I think that's really important.</blockquote>

		<p>Additionally, another participant added a suggestion involving organizers' families. She said, "Create a resource for Asian American women on learning how to talk to their parents about different issues, like sexism, classism, racism, like some sort of parent-child group therapy would be helpful." Still another participant offered a suggestion to "create an Asian Pacific American caucus to share ideas about what's working out there."</p>

		<h5>Working with other groups of color (16/20; 80%)</h5>
		<p>A majority of participants spoke about the powerful impact of working with groups of color in terms of learning, challenging one's assumptions, coalition-building, and generally enhancing the depth and breadth of one's organizing work. One participant said, "You can learn more from different community members, you can always learn from other people's struggles." This theme was echoed by other participants, as highlighted by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>I think coalition-building across groups of color is important because the more people you have, the more representation you have, the more support you have and the easier to make change and impact policy and make people notice that it effects many people in the community.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>It's very critical for APA women who are organizers to be able to make connections with other women of color. We need to learn from each other's struggles and successes given the magnitude of racism and xenophobia and we need to figure out which models get us to substantive and meaningful organizing work, not just coalitions.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>A lot of times I'm the only Asian American participating in the immigrant rights movement, or one of few, and I'm not sure why that is, but maybe internalized racism. I think the stereotype of the model minority really works against Asian Americans because instead of fighting with other people of color and trying to resist racism together I think that as a community we've kind of bought into racism and want to be included and want to benefit from the privileges of white Americans.</blockquote>

		<h5>Raising awareness and visibility (10/20; 50%)</h5>
		<p>Half of the participants suggested increasing awareness and visibility as methods of recruiting and sustaining Asian American women in organizing. One participant said, "We need to change curriculum to be more representative of our history. How much do they cover in textbooks about Asians?" Similarly, a second participant stated, "I think there needs to be better education about the community?A lot of people don't know about Chinatown or the Asian community?I think a lot of people would help if they could understand and make those connections."</p>

		<h5>Outreach (17/20; 85%)</h5>
		<p>Related to raising awareness and visibility, several participants also discussed the importance of developing new, more creative methods and venues for recruitment, as demonstrated by responses such as "reaching out to people because every one has a cause, they just need to be educated in more creative ways," and "You have to reach youth where they are at, with their music and their culture," and "?festivals, info booths, modern and contemporary showcases, it does attract a lot of young people, you have to capture their interest." Another participant commented on the role of potential partnerships in conducting outreach by stating, "Target public schools, promote public speaking and writing skills and expressive skills, there's a great need for more access and partnerships with community-based organizations." Additionally, participants described the importance of a personal connection during outreach, as illustrated by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>I think we need to be better, more friendly at reaching out to people, 'cuz I remember when I was more shy and uncomfortable talking to someone or asking questions or raising my hand, so maybe we just need to be more creative about engaging the quiet ones.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>If I see other women of color or queer women at a meeting or a march I make sure that I talk to them. I wouldn't want to lose potential members of the movement because of my neglect, I do feel like that's my responsibility , to give them a connection.</blockquote>

		<h5>Career recruitment (5/20; 25%)</h5>
		<p>As summarized by one participant, some of the women discussed the importance of showing "people that non-profits are an option at career fairs, show it as viable options." Building on this point, another participant said:</p>

		<blockquote>There were so many resources and recruiters if you wanted to go into something like investment banking, but if you were interested in going into something in the social services or non-profit, good luck! So I think it would be great to have leaders more present on campuses around the time when students are thinking about careers and thinking about their next move.</blockquote>

		<h5>Duplicating successful models (4/20; 20%)</h5>
		<p>A few participants spoke about organizations or spaces from their own lives that they would wish to see duplicated in an effort to recruit and support more Asian American women in community organizing, as highlighted by the following quotes:</p>

		<blockquote>Build more radical youth space like [organization]. Create more organizations for youth searching for an identity-based space, needing to reaffirm their identities in the face of racism, whatever, to be around people that look like you, they really wanted a space for young people that was political where people didn't have to sell themselves out just to hang out with other South Asians.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>There's this institute that I was part of two years ago and it was specifically for women of color who were in executive director or kind of leadership positions...it was like intensive training but also real kind of like nurturing? and I feel like those kind of places or spaces need to be more so more people could use them.</blockquote>

		<blockquote>At [organization], we have a program specifically for Korean American high school students, girls, and some other girls come through if they are friends, and that program is all about teaching organizing skills and supporting their leadership development and doing political education so that hopefully they will emerge as the future generation.</blockquote>

		<h5>Financial incentives (4/20; 20%)</h5>
		<p>Some participants commented on the need for more financial incentives to help recruit and support Asian American women in community organizing, with responses such as, "Scholarships. We have to put the money and commitment from the top and find people who are committed and make the programs run," and "Organizing in our society is not well-paid, it's just not something our society rewards people to do. It's hard to want a family and be an organizer so that puts people in a difficult choice." Another participant added that there should be "funds available to encourage Asian American social workers."</p>

		<h5>Professional development opportunities (2/20; 10%)</h5>
		<p>One participant nicely summarized the feedback about the importance of professional development opportunities with the following:</p>

		<blockquote>There's not just one way or organizing, there's not just one way of coalition-building. We need to provide opportunities for these people to grow, because I think that organizing is a professional career and there is professional development for that.</blockquote>

		<h5>Volunteerism (2/20; 10%)</h5>
		<p>A couple of participants also suggested that volunteerism could serve as a way to recruit future generations of Asian American women in community organizing. One participant said, "get them involved in community service, volunteering for a non-profit, gaining knowledge at an early age, start thinking about improving lives in general," and the second participant said, "Mandatory volunteerism. Do non-profit work. That would get more people."</p>

		<h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
		<p>In these three sections of data, twenty Asian American women who work in community organizing have described what led them to organizing in the first place, how organizing has impacted them, and how they believe they could recruit and support future generations of Asian American women as community organizers. Their narratives were drenched with the difficulties of living in and challenging systems of oppression in this country through their organizing work. They discussed painful experiences of racial and sexual harassment, homophobia and ageism and the invisibility of histories of marginalized groups. In addition, these women shared how organizing has raised their social and political consciousness, fostered feelings of connectedness, positively impacted their senses of self, assisted them in finding voice, and itself become a part of the way these women think about themselves. Finally, these women offered suggestions for sustaining those in the field and for recruiting those who will continue the work in the future.</p>
